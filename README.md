# CMPSC497: Hands-on Deep Learning
## Term - Fall19, Pennsylvania State University
Projects and Example for cmpsc497-fall19 term
The course focuses on teachig the students a practical approach to build deep neural networks and deploy them using full stack developement setup. It covers from developing tensorflow models to train and build a network to accelerating the DNNs using sepcilized hardware e.g. FPGAs. A special focus will be on OpenCL based FPGA accelerator develpoment and letting students accelerate their DNNs using an FPGA.
